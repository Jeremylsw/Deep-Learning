## 2. Quick, Draw! Simplified

<u>***How to use***</u>

1. **[Editing]** Download and Open Quickdraw.ipynb in Google Colab 
2. **[Viewing]** View [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-EJuskp4mXIa9LYXFWR-yHRaHxZJlFxi?usp=sharing)

<u>***Objective***</u>

To create a model like that of [Google's Quickdraw game](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) for selected classes and to experiment with alternate ML models and data pre-processing methods.
